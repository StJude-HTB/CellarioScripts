# CellarioScripts
This is a collection of scripts intended to be used as steps in Cellario (HighRes Biosolutions) automation protocols.  In some cases the scripts will be drop-in compatible with other systems; however, in most cases they will require some modification to reference device or step names that are used on the target system.

Script text can be copied and pasted into the Cellario Script Editor to make them available for use in new protocols.

These scripts come with no warranty that they will work and care should be exercised when using them to prevent physical damage to integrated devices.
